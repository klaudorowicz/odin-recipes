                <h3>Directions</h3>
                Meat Sauce:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion 
                        and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened. 
                        Add in the garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with 
                        the end of your spoon, until browned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon
                        and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer.
                        Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each)
                        and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, occasionally
                        mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Parmesan White Sauce:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from hot plate;
                        add the flour and whisk for about 30 seconds, or until well blended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk
                        in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. Once well blended, add the
                        remaining milk in 1 cup increments, mixing well after each addition,
                        until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the
                        sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a
                        nice and creamy consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce while stirring
                        occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes) and coats the
                        back of your wooden spoon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. Season with salt
                        and pepper and mix until the cheese is melted through.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                To Assemble:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 180°F.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spoon about 1 cup of meat sauce on the base of a 9x13-inch baking dish,
                        then cover with lasagna sheets. (Trim sheets to fit over the meat if
                        needed.) Layer with 2 cups of meat sauce (or enough to cover pasta),
                        1 cup of white sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
                        (leaving the remaining cheese for the top).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the remaining meat sauce and white sauce over the last layer of
                        lasagna sheets and top with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for
                        25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Garnish with parsley and let stand for about 10 minutes before slicing
                        and serving.
                    </li>
                </ol>
